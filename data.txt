outhwards from Highway 401 and travels through Hamilton and Mississauga before reuniting with the 401. It is concurrent and co-signed with the Queen Elizabeth Way (QEW) for 22 km (14 mi) from Burlington to Oakville. The 403 designation was applied to a short stub in 1963; the entire route was completed when the Brantford to Ancaster section opened on August 15, 1997. The Woodstock to Burlington stretch was dedicated as the Alexander Graham Bell Parkway in 2016. Most of Highway 403 runs through suburbia, although the areas west of Hamilton are agricultural except for Brantford. In Hamilton, Highway 403 descends the Niagara Escarpment, then runs north of Hamilton Harbour to the QEW. It then travels through Burlington and Oakville, departing from the QEW to the north at the Mississaugaâ€“Oakville boundary.
